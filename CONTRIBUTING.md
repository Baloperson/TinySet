# Contributing to tinyop

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. tinyop is a small, focused library and contributions should stay consistent with that — fixes, edge cases, and well-reasoned additions, not feature creep.

1. You are the original author of the contribution, or have the right to submit it.
2. Your contribution is provided under the **GNU General Public License v3.0** that governs this project.

## What to contribute

**Good contributions:**
- Bug fixes with a clear description of what was wrong and how to verify it's fixed
- Edge cases in spatial queries, transactions, or event handling that produce incorrect results
- Performance improvements with benchmark evidence (`node bench.js` before and after)
- Documentation corrections — wrong API shapes, misleading examples, typos
- Tests for untested behaviour

**Discuss first (open an issue before writing code):**
- New API methods or changes to existing method signatures
- Changes to the spatial indexing strategy or query engine
- Anything that would increase the bundle size meaningfully
- `tinyop+` changes involving sync or vector clock behaviour

**Out of scope:**
- Persistence backends — `store.dump()` and `store.checkpoint()` are the persistence boundary
- Framework integrations (React hooks, Vue plugins, etc.) — these belong in separate packages
- TypeScript types — may be added as a separate `.d.ts` file in future

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your change. Keep it focused — one fix or addition per PR.
3. Run the test suite and confirm all tests pass:
   ```bash
   node --test test.js
   ```
4. If your change adds new behaviour, add a test for it in `test.js`.
5. Open a pull request with a clear title and description. Reference any related issue. Describe how you verified the change works and doesn't break existing behaviour.

## Code style

tinyop core is intentionally dense. Match the existing style:

- No dependencies, no build step
- Compact but not obfuscated — variable names should be readable in context
- New public API methods follow the existing naming conventions (`find`, `near`, `get`, `create`, etc.)
- No TypeScript in the source files
- No comments in the minified-style sections of `tinyop.js` — the README is the documentation

---

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:

- The version of `tinyop.js` you are using
- A minimal reproduction — ideally a self-contained code snippet
- What you expected to happen and what actually happened
- Node version and environment if relevant (browser, React Native, etc.)
